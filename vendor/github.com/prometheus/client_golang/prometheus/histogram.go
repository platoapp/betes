// A Histogram counts individual observations from an event or sample stream in
// configurable buckets. Similar to a summary, it also provides a sum of
// observations and an observation count.
//
// On the Prometheus server, quantiles can be calculated from a Histogram using
// the histogram_quantile function in the query language.
//
// Note that Histograms, in contrast to Summaries, can be aggregated with the
// Prometheus query language (see the documentation for detailed
// procedures). However, Histograms require the user to pre-define suitable
// buckets, and they are in general less accurate. The Observe method of a
// Histogram has a very low performance overhead in comparison with the Observe
// method of a Summary.
//
// To create Histogram instances, use NewHistogram.
