Package spew implements a deep pretty printer for Go data structures to aid in
debugging.

A quick overview of the additional features spew provides over the built-in
printing facilities for Go data types are as follows:

	* Pointers are dereferenced and followed
	* Circular data structures are detected and handled properly
	* Custom Stringer/error interfaces are optionally invoked, including
	  on unexported types
	* Custom types which only implement the Stringer/error interfaces via
	  a pointer receiver are optionally invoked when passing non-pointer
	  variables
	* Byte arrays and slices are dumped like the hexdump -C command which
	  includes offsets, byte values in hex, and ASCII output (only when using
	  Dump style)

There are two different approaches spew allows for dumping Go data structures:

	* Dump style which prints with newlines, customizable indentation,
	  and additional debug information such as types and all pointer addresses
	  used to indirect to the final value
	* A custom Formatter interface that integrates cleanly with the standard fmt
	  package and replaces %v, %+v, %#v, and %#+v to provide inline printing
	  similar to the default %v while providing the additional functionality
	  outlined above and passing unsupported format verbs such as %x and %q
	  along to fmt
